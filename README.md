# Towards a universal gateset for QMA‚ÇÅ

This repository contains a preprint of my upcoming paper.

## Errata

The argument containment of the clique homology problem in PSPACE in the paper is insufficient. Instead, we can check whether the homology is trivial by computing the rank of the Laplacian in NC(poly)=PSPACE using Chistov's algorithm:

## Supplementary material

The scripts require [SageMath](https://www.sagemath.org/) (tested with version 10.4).
The code was tested on macOS using the SageMath distribution [Sage_macOS](https://github.com/3-manifolds/Sage_macOS) and on Arch Linux using the `sagemath` package.
